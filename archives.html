<b>A Game of Kings</b>
</div>

<div class="modal">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <p>On the board of eight by eight<br>
    An army prepares<br>
      For war, intimidating the opponent<br>
      With steadfast, iron glares<br><br>
      
      When comes the pawn, an infantryman<br>
      Marking the beginning<br>
      Of a battle of the most glorious type<br>
      Of sacrifice for the king<br><br>
      
      Soon blood does stain the battlefield<br>
      The objective ever clear<br>
      To scare the king out of his wits<br>
      To trap the king with fear<br><br>
      
      Alas! Alas! Our king is dead<br>
      Bested, that he was<br>
      From the few survivors a groan does rise<br>
      They fought for an empty cause

<b>The Roundabout Race</b>
</div>

<div id="candmModal" class="modal">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <p>The Cat and The Mouse were dashing around the house<br>
In a frenzied sort of race<br>
      The Mouse was scared to his bones<br>
      You should have seen his face<br><br>
      Round and round they went about<br>
      The circuit that was home<br>
      Jolting here and bolting there<br>
      Everywhere the mouse did roam!<br><br>
      So as the two did swerve into<br>
      The peaceful nursery<br>
      A cry of panic, of utter distress<br>
      Came from the way of the startled baby<br><br>
      The mouse did know that if they found him<br>
      It would be certain doom<br>
      The mouse was wise so he let his eyes<br>
      Guide him to his room

<b>Life Cycle of a Bubble</b>
</div>

<div class="modal">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <p>
      A floating orb, a glittering sphere<br>
      Bouncing between there and here<br>
      Higher and lower he does go about<br>
      Drifting everywhere, what is its route?<br><br>
      The glossy ball goes up and down<br>
      And all around the town<br>
      Hopping and bopping it's going to go places<br>
      Meeting new people, greeting new faces!<br><br>
      Now gaining altitude it did go<br>
      Soaring above the trees<br>
      But he will soon come to know<br>
      That that too has its fees<br><br>
      Cruising o'er the pinpoint people<br>
      His story shan't end with a drop<br>
      Instead, while rounding the tall church steeple<br>
      He ends with a petty pop!

<b>A Sunday Night in <br>Quarantine</b>
</div>

<div class="modal">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <p>
      Near the buzz of the TV<br>
      As happy as one could be<br>
      On a night in Quarantine<br><br>
      When the beast is lurking<br>
      Invisible and bold<br>
      Inside, me and my family<br>
      Take shelter from the cold<br><br>
      Why do I stare away from<br>
      The daunting outside world<br>
      Perhaps to keep myself from<br>
      The disaster that's unfurled<br><br>
      Curled up with my family<br>
      Near the buzz of the TV<br>
      I yearn to be free

Marvelous Monday Madness<br>
      Is now alll but gone<br>
      Silence does take its place<br>

      Accompanied by<br>
      A symphony of yawns

    <b>Silent City</b>
</div>

<div class="modal">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <p>
What is a city without its people<br>
Is what I wonder<br>
As I stare out my window<br>
Sans screams<br>
Sans shrieks<br>
Sans citizens<br>
Its true colors it cannot show<br><br>
When the green is replaced by white<br>
Of hospitals<br>
Of fear<br>
Then in the parks<br>
Not chirps<br>
But silence do you hear

<b>The Snowstorm</b>

  <div class="modal-content">
    <p>
      We trek and trek through the biting snow<br>
      Up and up and up we go<br>
      Each snowflake biting like a knife<br>
      Face frozen cold<br>
      But...<br>
      It's inevitable, a part of life<br><br>
      What idiocy is "Winter Wonderland"<br>
      I'd rather be on the beach<br>
      In the sand

    <p>
What came first<br>
The seed or the tree?<br>
But a circle has no start<br>
So how can such an answer be?<br>
Yet a circle is drawn starting somewhere<br>
So I must disagree<br>
And while the latter is true<br>
When a circle is drawn<br>
The start you cannot see

<b>My Brother</b>

    <p>
      In every land place or time<br>
      Every location, every clime<br>
      My brother has been with me<br><br>
      Every Everest turned a mound<br>
      When I heard the comforting sound<br>
      Of my brother's footsteps inching towards me<br><br>
      Though younger he may be<br>
      He forever motivates me<br>
      When all hope is lost<br><br>
      Consoling and controlling me<br>
      Is harder than it looks, you see<br>
      Yet my brother's always there<br><br>
      So even on the wildest rides<br>
      My brother's always by my side

    <b>The Grumblings of a <br>Sun Lover</b>
</div>

<div class="modal">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <p>
Oh! How I long for the days of summer<br>
When the days are nice and long<br>
When the little birds, in their trees<br>
Sing a long forgotten song<br>
Carried by the warm, mellow breeze<br>
Cleansed by April showers<br>
Every breath full of laughter and ease<br>
Oh! How I long for the days of summer<br><br>
Yet now we're stuck with winter<br>
Where the lights go out snip-snap<br>
Before we know it-the sky is pitch black<br><br>
When comes the biting cold<br>
Omnipresent, everywhere<br>
Everyone in its hold<br>
For winter is its lair<br>
Oh! Why must it be winter?

    <b>Achilles' Heel</b>
</div>

<div class="modal">
  <div class="modal-content">
    <p>
You may wear a mask to conceal yourself<br>
Yet I can still see your face<br>
For one's true colors shine behind the cloth<br>
Cotton, wool and lace<br><br>
You may be hardened like steel<br>
But even that does melt<br>
For when an arrow struck Achilles' heel<br>
He fell and others knelt<br><br>
Don't keep your quiver too close to you<br>
For then it shall stain<br>
For longing and hopefulness<br>
Yet with agony and pain

     Can you taste the ocean spray<br>

      Swaying over other plants?<br><br>

      Reds and yellows, my oh my<br><br>
